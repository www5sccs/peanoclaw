/**
 * Hides the storage of Patchdata from the user. I.e. this maps data
 * accesses from a subcell-pattern to the actual array stored within
 * the heap data of the Peano cells.
 *
 * It also encaspulates the fact that there are always two copies of
 * the data, here called uNew and uOld. Since uOld also holds the
 * boundary conditions, the size of both arrays does not match (uNew
 * is subdivisionFactor x subdivisionFactor, while uOld is
 * (subdivisionFactor+ghostLayerWidth*2) x (subdivisionFactor +
 * ghostLayerWidth*2)).
 *
 * To make the access pattern more intuitive, the ghostlayer is neglected
 * when indexing the arrays. I.e. indices in one dimension are in the
 * interval [0..subdivisionFactor-1] for uNew and in
 * [-ghostLayerWidth..subdivisionFactor+ghostLayerWidth*2-1] for uOld. By
 * this the subcell (x,y) is accessed by the same indices for uOld and uNew.
 *
 * !!! States
 * Each spacetree node is considered of holding a patch. However, not each
 * patch actually holds valid grid data. Patches can have three states:
 *
 * !! Leaf
 * A leaf patch is a patch located in a leaf node of the spacetree grid.
 * That means it contains valid arrays for the current and the last
 * timestep. The currentTime and timestepSize fields span the time interval
 * that corresponds to the stored grid data.
 *
 * !! Refined
 * A refined patch is a patch that is located in an inner node of the
 * spacetree. It does not contain valid arrays neither for the current
 * nor the last timestep. The only exception is a virtual patch.
 *
 * The question is what the time interval represents for a refined patch.
 *
 * The currentTime and timestepSize correspond to the time interval spanned
 * by all overlapped fine cells. I.e. this is the set of points that is
 * covered by all child patches of this patch. In the figure below this is
 * called "minimal fine patch time interval". By this approach all time
 * stepping restrictions on neighboring patches can be done in a natural
 * way, since the restrictions by finer patches can be applied by just
 * taking the restriction of the time interval spanned by a refined patch.
 *
 * Since this time interval is gathered during the traversal of the child
 * patches, this information refers to the last grid iteration in the
 * enterCell and touchVertexFirstTime events and refers to the current grid
 * iteration in the leaveCell, touchVertexLastTime, and destroyCell events.
 * In all other events this information is not reliable.
 *
 * There is one more relevant time interval for a refined patch: The maximum
 * neighbor time interval spans the time interval between the oldest
 * currentTime and the newest currentTime+timestepSize of all neighbor
 * patches. This time is valid from including enterCell.
 *
 * The images afterwards show the idea of the mentioned time intervals. The
 * first one shows a situation in 2d with a refined patch. The fact that
 * this refinement pattern is illegal in Peano is here ignored for the sake
 * of simplicity. The second image shows the same example but in 1d to
 * clarify the different time intervals.
 *
 * !! Virtual
 * A virtual patch is a special kind of refined patch. Virtual patches hold
 * valid grid data, which are created by restricting the grid data of
 * underlying fine patches. This is used for filling ghostlayers of
 * neighboring coarse patches. Since the child patches span different time
 * intervals, some kind of mapping needs to be done to get a time interval
 * that is spanned by the virtual patch. For this we use the "maximum
 * neighbor time interval" and inter-/extrapolate the fine patch data to
 * this interval. After the iteration of the child patches the actual
 * time interval for the refined patch is known, so the data can be
 * interpolated from the "maximum neighbor time interval" to the
 * "minimal fine patch time interval".
 *
 * @image html refined-patch-time-intervals-2d.png
 *
 * @image html refined-patch-time-intervals-1d.png
 *
 * The second image also shows the minimal neighbor time. This is the
 * minimum over the upper limit of the time intervals of the neighboring
 * patches. This restricts the time stepping for this patch, if it is a
 * leaf patch, or the underlying fine patches, if the current patch is
 * refined.
 *
 * TODO: Rewrite the Patch class so that it directly works on the CellDescriptions.
 * So, we have just a frontend and each Patch contains a valid CellDescription object.
