    /**
     * Mapping constructor.
     *
     * Mappings have to have a standard constructor and, typically, no other 
     * constructor does exist. While the constructor may initialise a mapping, 
     * Peano's concept requires the mapping to be semi-stateless:
     *
     * - At construction time the mapping has no well-defined state, i.e. the 
     *   values set by the constructor are meaningless.
     * - Whenever the mapping's beginIteration() operation is called, the 
     *   mapping has to initialise itself. To do this, it has to analyse the 
     *   passed state object. The beginIteration() operation may set attributes 
     *   of the mapping and these attributes now have a valid state.
     * - All the subsequent calls on the mapping can rely on valid mapping 
     *   attributes until
     * - The operation endIteration() is invoked. Afterwards, all the mapping's 
     *   attributes have an undefined state.
     *
     * With this concept, you cannot ensure a consistent mapping state 
     * in-between two iterations: While the first iteration might set some 
     * mapping attributes, the attributes become invalid after the first 
     * endIteration() call and might be changed from outside before the next 
     * beginIteration() is invoked.
     *
     * To implement persistent attributes, you have to write back all these  
     * attributes at endIteration() and reload them at the next beginIteration() 
     * call. With this sometimes confusing persistency concept, we can ensure 
     * that your code works on a parallel machine and for any mapping/algorithm 
     * modification.

     * In Peano's multithreaded mode, each mapping is duplicated among the

     * of a parallel section, the individual copies of the mappings are 
     * merged together into one the global state instance again. 
     * 
     * If there are t threads, Peano takes the original mapping and makes t 
     * copies. Then, the t copies are ran in parallel. In the end, the t copies 
     * are merged into the original step by step. If your mapping holds 
     * variables, also these variables are copied per thread. If you have 
     * pointers, be sure that those are copied in the constructor as well or

     * While this is the right place to merge parallel data, and while you

     * is copied to all thread-local mappings and all threads use the same object
     * on the heap. However, you should protect this object by a BooleanSemaphore

     * surrounding cells. The grid already has found out that this will be an 
     * inner vertex, however, you have to set valid vertices.
     *
     * The vertices have an attribute position or x, too. However, this 
     * attribute is available in Debug mode only and it should be used solely 
     * to implement assertions. To work with the vertex's position, use the 
     * attribute x instead.
     *
     * @image html peano/grid/geometry-vertex-inside-outside.png
     *
     * If you are working with moving geometries, an inner vertex is either 
     * created at startup time or it is a former boundary vertex becoming an 
     * inner vertex now. To recognise the latter case is up to you, as every
     * PDE reacts differently.
     *
     * It might seem to make sense to add an assertion such as 
     * \code 
 assertion1( isInside() || isBoundary(), *this );
 \endcode
     * at the very beginning of your implementation. However, such an assertion 
     * fails as Peano switches the vertex type after the initialisation routine. 
     * The reason for this behaviour is simple: For moving boundaries, often 
     * you'd like to know what type the vertex had before (was it outside or 
     * was it an inner point becoming a boundary/boundary point becoming an 
     * inner point). This is possible, if the type is switched after the 
     * initialisation.
     *
     * The refinement process cuts a coarse grid cell into pieces. You have 
     * access to this coarse grid data via coarseGridCell (coarse grid's cell
     * data), coarseGridVertices, and the corresponding 
     * coarseGridVerticesEnumerator. The coarse grid cell always is cut into 
     * @f$ 3^d @f$ subcubes, i.e. two cuts along each coordinate axis. The 
     * integer vector fineGridPositionOfVertex (each entry is in-between zero
     * and 4) tells you where within this local fine grid the new vertex is 
     * located. You may modify both the fine grid vertex and the coarse grid
     * vertices and cells. However, only the initialisation of fineGridVertex
     * is mandatory.
     *
     * !!! Vertex and cell lifecycle
     * 
     * Please consult peano/grid/vertex-lifecycle.doxys for details on the 
     * vertex and cell lifecycle.
     *
     * !!! Addendum to fine grid vertex position and vertex event order
     *
     * One fundamental principle of Peano is that you don't know exact event 
     * orders. It is up to Peano to decide in which order it triggers the 
     * operations of your mappings as long as certain partial orders are 
     * preserved (enterCell() after touchVertexFirstTime(), e.g.). For a 
     * discussion of the partial orders, please confer the page vertex 
     * lifecycle of the peano::grid component.
     *
     * If a patch is created, you consequently don't know in which order the 
     * vertices are created. Neither do you know later in which order touch 
     * first or last is called. There are many reasons for this besides the 
     * fact that there is no need to expose traversal orders. The most 
     * important reason is that the freedom for the Peano kernel allows the 
     * latter to reorder events as long as logical constraints represented by 
     * the partial order are preserved. Reordering might yield a speedup. More 
     * important is that the kernel even might decide to trigger events in 
     * parallel in shared memory environments. The parallel execution however 
     * is disabled for creational events and works only for touch first/last.
     *
     * We know that all vertices adjacent to a cell are created 
     * before the cell itself is created. We also know that all vertices and 
     * cells in the spacetree that are coarser than the current vertex have 
     * been created before. Again, there are nondeterministic effects: Study
     * a @f$ 6\times 3 @f$ grid in 2d, i.e. a grid with 18 fine grid cells 
     * and two coarse cells. We refer to the coarse grid as left and right 
     * cell. When the vertex (3,1) in the patch is created (we start to count 
     * with zero), you do not know a priori whether the corresponding coarse 
     * cell is the left one or the right one.
     *
     * However, Peano passes the integer array fineGridPositionOfVertex to 
     * the events (same holds for touch first/last and destroy). That one 
     * tells you within the current patch the position of the vertex. If this 
     * argument in the previous example is (3,1), then the code currently is 
     * descending in the left coarse grid cell. If the argument is (0,1) it 
     * has been descending in the right. You can access all @f$ 2^d @f$ coarse 
     * grid vertices and you can be sure that they have been initialised 
     * before. With fineGridPositionOfVertex you can interpolate data from 
     * the coarse grid as you know where the vertex is located relative to the 
     * coarse grid vertices.

     *
     * !!! Data Consistency
     *
     * Multilevel data consistency in Peano can be tricky. Most codes thus 
     * introduce a rigorous master-owns pattern. In this case, always the

     * reasons for this assymetry.

     * received records are merged into the worker's local data due to 
     * mergeWithWorker(). While this operation gives you access to both the 
     * cell and its adjacent vertices in the same order as prepareSendToWorker(),
     * the mergeWithWorker() operations are called on-the-fly in a (probably) 
     * different order, as their order depends on the global space-filling curve.
     *
     * If you manipulate receivedCell or receivedVertices(), respectively, 
     * these modified values will be passed to mergeWithWorker(). The classical 
     * use case is that prepareSendToWorker() sends away some heap data. This 
     * heap data then should be received in this operation, as you have all data 
     * available here in the same order as prepareSendToWorker(). Distribute the 
     * received heap data among the @f$ 2^d +1 @f$ out arguments you have 
     * available. The modified arguments then are forwarded by Peano to 
     * mergeWithWorker().
     *
     * !!! Rationale
     * 
     * The split of the receive process into two stages seems to be artificial 
     * and not very much straightforward. However, two constraints make it 
     * necessary:
     * - Some applications need a single receive point where the data received 
     *   has the same order as prepareSendToWorker().
     * - Some applications need well-initialised vertices when they descend 
     *   somewhere in the worker tree. This descend usually not in the central 
     *   element but an outer part of the tree, i.e. some vertices have to be 
     *   merged before we can also merge the cell and all other vertices.
     *
     * !!! Heap data
     *
     * If you are working with a heap data structure, your vertices or cells, 
     * respectively, hold pointers to the heap. The received records hold 
     * pointer indices as well. However, these pointers are copies from the 
     * remote ranks, i.e. the pointers are invalid though seem to be set.
     * Receive heap data instead separately without taking the pointers in 
     * the arguments into account. 
     *
     * If you receive heap data and need it in the actual merge operation, 
     * i.e. in mergeWithWorker(), we recommend to follow the subsequent steps: 
     * 
     * - Create an entry on the heap here for each vertex.
     * - Store the received data within these heap entries.
     * - Merge the heap data within mergeWithWorker().
     *
     * - Remove the heap entries created in this operation within mergeWithWorker().
     * @param coarseGridVertices  Copy of the coarse vertices of the master 
     *                            node as well worker's records. As you receive 
     *                            the copy, you can alter the local ones, but 
     *                            any change to this data will remain local on this 
     *                            worker, i.e. changes are not committed back to the 
     *                            master. Also, the changes might be lost from adapter
     *                            run to adapter run, i.e. if you switch the adapter
     *                            you wanna use, Peano might come up with different
