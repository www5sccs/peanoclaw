     * Mapping constructor.
     *
     * Mappings have to have a standard constructor and, typically, no other 
     * constructor does exist. While the constructor may initialise a mapping, 
     * Peano's concept requires the mapping to be semi-stateless:
     *
     * - At construction time the mapping has no well-defined state, i.e. the 
     *   values set by the constructor are meaningless.
     * - Whenever the mapping's beginIteration() operation is called, the 
     *   mapping has to initialise itself. To do this, it has to analyse the 
     *   passed state object. The beginIteration() operation may set attributes 
     *   of the mapping and these attributes now have a valid state.
     * - All the subsequent calls on the mapping can rely on valid mapping 
     *   attributes until
     * - The operation endIteration() is invoked. Afterwards, all the mapping's 
     *   attributes have an undefined state.
     *
     * With this concept, you cannot ensure a consistent mapping state 
     * in-between two iterations: While the first iteration might set some 
     * mapping attributes, the attributes become invalid after the first 
     * endIteration() call and might be changed from outside before the next 
     * beginIteration() is invoked.
     *
     * To implement persistent attributes, you have to write back all these  
     * attributes at endIteration() and reload them at the next beginIteration() 
     * call. With this sometimes confusing persistency concept, we can ensure 
     * that your code works on a parallel machine and for any mapping/algorithm 
     * modification.

     * merged together into one the global state instance again.

     * If there are t threads, Peano takes the original mapping and makes t 
     * copies. Then, the t copies are ran in parallel. In the end, the t copies 
     * are merged into the original step by step. If your mapping holds 
     * variables, also these variables are copied per thread. If you have

     * is copied to all thread-local mappings and all threads use the same object
     * on the heap. However, you should protect this object by a BooleanSemaphore

     * Remarks:  
     * - If you need the position of the vertices of the cell or its size, use the 
     *   enumerator.
     * - If the destory is invoked due to load balancing, it is called after the

     * The split of the receive process into two stages seems to be artificial

     * necessary:
     * - Some applications need a single receive point where the data received 
     *   has the same order as prepareSendToWorker().
     * - Some applications need well-initialised vertices when they descend 
     *   somewhere in the worker tree. This descend usually not in the central 
     *   element but an outer part of the tree, i.e. some vertices have to be 
     *   merged before we can also merge the cell and all other vertices.
     *
     * !!! Heap data
     *
     * If you are working with a heap data structure, your vertices or cells, 
     * respectively, hold pointers to the heap. The received records hold 
     * pointer indices as well. However, these pointers are copies from the 
     * remote ranks, i.e. the pointers are invalid though seem to be set.
     * Receive heap data instead separately without taking the pointers in 
     * the arguments into account. 
     *
     * If you receive heap data and need it in the actual merge operation, 
     * i.e. in mergeWithWorker(), we recommend to follow the subsequent steps: 
     * 
     * - Create an entry on the heap here for each vertex.
     * - Store the received data within these heap entries.
     * - Merge the heap data within mergeWithWorker().
     * - Remove the heap entries created in this operation within mergeWithWorker().

     * Read vertex the first time throughout one iteration
     *
     * In the Peano world, an algorithm tells the grid that the grid should be 
     * traversed. The grid then decides how to do this and runs over all cells
     * and vertices. Whenever the grid traversal reads a vertex the very first 
     * time throughout an iteration, it invokes touchVertexFirstTime() for this 
     * vertex. Then, it calls handleCell up to @f$ 2^d @f$ times for the 
     * adjacent cells and passes this vertex to these calls. Finally, the grid
     * traversal invokes touchVertexLastTime(), i.e. the counterpart of this 
     * operation.
     *
     * @image html peano/grid/geometry-vertex-inside-outside.png
     *
     * The operation is called for both each inner and boundary vertices.
     * These vertices have an attribute position, too. However, this 
     * attribute is available in Debug mode only and it should be used solely 
     * to implement assertions. To work with the vertex's position, use the 
     * attribute fineGridX instead. The latter is availble all the time (the 
     * vertex's attribute is a redundant information that is just to be used
     * for correctness and consistency checks). 
     *
     * Vertices may have persistent and non-persistent attributes (see the 
     * documentation of the DaStGen tool). Attributes that are not persistent 
     * are not stored in-between two iterations, i.e. whenever 
     * touchVertexFirstTime() is called, these attributes contain garbage. So,
     * this operation is the right place to initialise the non-persistent 
     * attributes of a vertex.
     *
     * !!! Thread-safety
     *
     * This operation is not thread safe with respect to the coarse grid 
     * vertices and the coarse grid cell. With respect to the fine grid 
     * vertices, it is thread safe. It is not thread safe with respect to the 
     * fine grid cell. 
     * 
     * !!! Optimisation
     * 
     * This operation is invoked if and only if the corresponding specification 
     * flag does not hold NOP. Due to this specification flag you also can define 
     * whether this operation works on the leaves only, whether it may be 
     * called in parallel by multiple threads, and whether it is fail-safe or 
     * can at least be called multiple times if a thread crashes.
     *
     * If this operation works only on leaves, the operation is sometimes not 
     * called if Peano can be sure that all adjacent cells are refined. The 
     * sometimes implies that this specification induces and optimisation - it 
     * does not enforce that the operation is not called under certain 
     * circumstances.

     * Read vertex the last time throughout one iteration
     *
     * In the Peano world, an algorithm tells the grid that the grid should be 
     * traversed. The grid then decides how to do this and runs over all cells
     * and vertices. Whenever the grid traversal reads a vertex the very first 
     * time throughout an iteration, it invokes touchVertexFirstTime() for this 
     * vertex. Then, it calls handleCell up to @f$ 2^d @f$ times for the 
     * adjacent cells and passes this vertex to these calls. Finally, the grid
     * traversal invokes touchVertexLastTime().
     *
     * @image html peano/grid/geometry-vertex-inside-outside.png
     *
     * The operation is called for both each inner and boundary vertices.
     * These vertices have an attribute position or x, too. However, this 
     * attribute is available in Debug mode only and it should be used solely 
     * to implement assertions. To work with the vertex's position, use the 
     * attribute x instead.
     *
     * Vertices may have persistent and non-persistent attributes (see the 
     * documentation of the DaStGen tool). Attributes that are not persistent 
     * are not stored in-between two iterations, i.e. whenever 
     * touchVertexFirstTime() is called, these attributes contain garbage. So,
     * this operation is the right place to do something with the non-persistent 
     * attributes. As soon as this operation terminates, these attributes are 
     * lost.
     *
     * !!! Thread-safety
     *
     * This operation is not thread safe with respect to the coarse grid 
     * vertices and the coarse grid cell. With respect to the fine grid 
     * vertices, it is thread safe. It is not thread safe with respect to the 
     * fine grid cell. 
     * 
     * !!! Optimisation
     * 
     * This operation is invoked if and only if the corresponding specification 
     * flag does not holds NOP. Due to this specification flag you also can define 
     * whether this operation works on the leaves only, whether it may be 
     * called in parallel by multiple threads, and whether it is fail-safe or 
     * can at least be called multiple times if a thread crashes.
     *
     * If this operation works only on leaves, the operation is sometimes not 
     * called if Peano can be sure that all adjacent cells are refined. The 
     * sometimes implies that this specification induces and optimisation - it 
     * does not enforce that the operation is not called under certain 
     * circumstances.
